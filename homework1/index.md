# Homework 1

## Introduction

For this homework, 3 datasets from [TCMB website](https://evds2.tcmb.gov.tr/) and relevant datasets from [Google Trends](http://trends.google.com/) was used. The aim is to see if the datasets from TCMB are related with an independant dataset, possibly from Google Trends.

## Model 1 - Clothing Expenditures and Holidays

In Turkey, it is common for people to buy new clothes before the religious holidays, namely Ramadan and Eid. In this sense, the data between clothing expenditures and holidays might be investigated.

Assuming that people search about these holidays more when the date is close, the Google Trends data for search "Bayram" or "Ramazan" or "Kurban" can be checked.
